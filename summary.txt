Project Name: M.A.P. (Mental Health & Academics at Penn)

Project Description: In this project, we wanted to analyze the relationship between CAPS/mental health and academics, as represented by 
Reddit posts on the r/UPenn subreddit. Our motivation for this is that given final exams are currently underway, we suspected that there 
might be some relationship between CAPS-related posts and academic-related posts that we could find evidence of in the subreddit. For this
reason, we conducted an analysis on the relationship between mental health (CAPS) and academics, through several hypotheses as described in
our final report. These hypotheses included analyzing cosine similarity, points & upvote/downvote ratios, sentiment analysis, and affiliation
networks.

Project Categories:
- Document Search
- Social Networks (+graphs)

Breakdown of Work:
- Rohit: Sentiment analysis + Affiliation network graph
- Augustin: Points and upvote/downvote ratio
- Sam: Cosine similarity
- Everyone: worked on writeup, data visualizations, final integration of project code
